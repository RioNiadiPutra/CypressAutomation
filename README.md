# Hello, Welcome to my Soapleasure Automation Testing Portofolio

In this automation testing, I used Cypress Framework Automation and created several test scripts for modules such as account registration, login, product search, and checkout product as a guest. Some of the scripts include both negative and positive testing. I have also attached the test cases I have created, you can check it out:

I also did a demo of my automation testing on YouTube, and here is the link:

I really appreciate any feedback or suggestions regarding my automation testing, whether it's related to the scripts or the test cases.

#### Thank You !
